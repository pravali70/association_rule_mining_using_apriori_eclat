🛒 Association Rule Mining using Apriori and ECLAT Algorithms
🎯 Objective
Discover meaningful patterns in customer purchase behavior using Association Rule Mining to help businesses improve product placement, bundling strategies, and recommendation systems.

🔍 What is Association Rule Mining?
Association Rule Mining is a data mining technique that uncovers relationships between items frequently purchased together. It enables businesses to identify shopping patterns and make data-driven decisions for better sales and marketing strategies.

🚀 Techniques Used
Apriori Algorithm
Identifies frequent itemsets by applying a bottom-up approach using minimum support thresholds.

ECLAT Algorithm
An efficient technique that uses vertical data representation and TID-set intersections to generate frequent itemsets.

Association Rule Extraction
From the frequent itemsets, rules are derived using a confidence threshold to highlight strong associations between products.
